# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a annual set of christmas themed programming problesm that follow an advent calendar. I have heard about Advent of Code (AoC from now on) before but never committed time or resources to it.

Struggling to learn C, I decided to go through the AoC content from 2015 to current and complete each of the challenges with at a minimum, attempting to use C. The nice thing about doing the older problems, well really any problem, is that there are plenty of resources around online to help me work through and solve the problems.

Fun Fact! I did not know that people could prestiege programming problems but I recently learned, that [people have prestieged AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard). I guess at the end of the day, it is a game :)
